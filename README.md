# Bike_Stores_Analysis 
In this bike stores analysis project, I utilized a combination of tools including Microsoft SQL Server, Excel, and Tableau to gain valuable insights into the performance and trends of several bike stores. The objective was to create a comprehensive overview of the stores' sales. 
I started on Microsoft SQL server by creating a table and inserting extensive data. Then, after cleaning the data using queries I imported into excel where it was used to create a fully dynamic dashboard the summarizes the results.
